# Text-to-Speech App with Streamlit

A simple text-to-speech application built with Streamlit and pyttsx3.

## Features

- Convert text to speech
- Adjust speech rate and volume
- Choose between male and female voices
- Download the generated audio file

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Streamlit
- pyttsx3

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the Streamlit app:
```
streamlit run app.py
```

Then open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8501

## Notes

This app uses pyttsx3 which is an offline text-to-speech conversion library. It uses the TTS engines available on your system.

### Windows
- Uses SAPI5
- No additional installation needed

### MacOS
- Uses NSSpeechSynthesizer
- No additional installation needed

### Linux
- Uses eSpeak
- You may need to install it: `sudo apt-get install espeak`

# 🗣️ Voice Cloning Text-to-Speech App (Python)

This is a Python-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) application that clones a voice from a reference audio sample and generates speech in the same voice from custom text input.

---

## 📌 Features

- Clone any voice using a short audio sample (5–20 seconds)
- Convert any text into speech using the cloned voice
- Save or play the generated audio
- Easy-to-use interface with [streamlit] (optional)

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

### Python Version
- Python 3.8 – 3.10 (recommended)

### Dependencies
Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install TTS torchaudio soundfile numpy scipy librosa gradio
```

If you are using **Real-Time Voice Cloning**, also install:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning
cd Real-Time-Voice-Cloning
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/voice-clone-tts.git
cd voice-clone-tts
```

### 2. Prepare Your Voice Sample
Place a short voice recording (`.wav` format, 16kHz mono) in the project folder and name it `voice_sample.wav`.

### 3. Run the App
```bash
python app.py
```

Or if using Gradio:
```bash
python app_gradio.py
```

## ✨ Example Usage

Once the app is running:
1. Upload a reference voice sample.
2. Type your text.
3. Click "Generate" to produce audio in the cloned voice.
4. Download or listen to the result.

## 🧠 Models Used

You can choose from:

- [Coqui TTS](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS) – high-quality open-source TTS
- [Real-Time Voice Cloning](https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning) – pretrained models for cloning
- [ElevenLabs API](https://www.elevenlabs.io/) – commercial, API-based (optional)

---

## 📌 Notes

- A GPU is highly recommended for faster audio synthesis.
- Audio sample quality affects the accuracy of the cloned voice.
- Some models may require additional model files (check their GitHub for instructions).
